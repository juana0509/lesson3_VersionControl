            </h2>
            <p class="lead">It is a good idea for web developers or coders to be able to save a recover past versions of files while working on projects. A version control system (VCS) is one main repository for all of the project files that helps facilitate the sharing and editing of files or recovery. A VCS records changes to a file and allows you to recall on those changes or specific versions whenever. VCS automatically notes who changes the file, when they were changed, what about them is new or different, and when a merge changes in to the same file. Once a repository is created in a VCS, developers can track those changes or the history of a file. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is essential for developers to track the history and changes of a file. Using a version control system is very useful because once a file is saved it cannot be overwritten.  A VCS is also useful for team projects because people can work on the same files constantly and simultaneously without conflict. Every VCS has a common repository where all the latest files are held. It allows to revert to older versions to files, revert and entire project back to a previous state and a VCS will back up your files so if you lose files, you can easily recover them. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Types of Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are a variety of version control systems, one of them is known as a Local VCS, local VCSs have a simple database that keeps all the changes of the files under revision control. There are also centralized version control systems that have a single server that contains all versions of files; clients can check the files from tis central server. CVCS had been the standard for version control for a while, but it poses a big threat and that is that if the server goes down you could lose all files because its all centralized. There are also Distributed Version Control systems such as Git. With this type of VCS clients are allowed to see fully mirrored files in the repository.  If a server dies, the systems working with it or the clients can easily copy back up to the server and restore files. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">History of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git began with an open source software project known as the Linux kernel. In 2002, the project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper. The community that helped maintain Linux and BitKeeper broke down and with it the toolâ€™s free software. The remaining Linux community used there past knowledge of BitKeeper to develop their own tool. The goals of the new system were speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development, fully distributed, and be able to handle large projects efficiently. This system is now known as Git, and has evolved into an easy to use version control system. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git thinks of its data as a set of snapshots or a miniature file system.  When a client commits, or saves the state of a project in Git, it takes a picture of how all files look at the moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. Essentially Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots. Git has three main states that files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged. Committed means the data is stored on your local database, modified means that you have changes the file but not committed it to your database. Modified means that you have changed the file but not committed it to the database yet.  There are three main sections of Git, the git directory, the working directory and the staging area. </p>
